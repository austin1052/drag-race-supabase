# Supabase Starter

This starter configures Supabase Auth to use cookies, making the user's session available throughout the entire Next.js app - Client Components, Server Components, Route Handlers, Server Actions and Middleware.

## Deploy your own

The Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project. After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be set up so that the project is usable immediately after deployment ðŸš€

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&integration-ids=oac_jUduyjQgOyzev1fjrW83NYOv)

## How to use

1. Create a [new Supabase project](https://database.new)
1. Run `npx create-next-app -e with-supabase` to create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template
1. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
1. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update the values for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the local development server

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.

### Create a Supabase client

Check out the [`/app/_examples`](./app/_examples/) folder for an example of creating a Supabase client in:

- [Client Components](./app/_examples/client-component/page.tsx)
- [Server Components](./app/_examples/server-component/page.tsx)
- [Route Handlers](./app/_examples/route-handler/route.ts)
- [Server Actions](./app/_examples/server-action/page.tsx)

### Create `todo` table and seed with data (optional)

Navigate to [your project's SQL Editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/sql), click `New query`, paste the contents of the [init.sql](./supabase/migrations/20230618024722_init.sql) file and click `RUN`.

This will create a basic `todos` table, enable Row Level Security (RLS), and write RLS policies enabling `select` and `insert` actions for `authenticated` users.

To seed your `todos` table with some dummy data, run the contents of the [seed.sql](./supabase/seed.sql) file.

## Feedback and issues

## Git Processes

### Building a new branch
```bash
    # Switch to main to get the latest changes from other people
    git checkout main
    git pull
    git checkout -b "NEW_BRANCH_NAME"
```
### Committing your changes to this branch
```bash
    # Stage your changes (include them in your next commit)
    # . represents the current folder
    git add .
    git commit -m "Explaination of the changes you made in past tense"
    # eg. git commit -m "added the first schema to the database"
    git push -u origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
    # eg. git push -u origin standings-page
    # if branch already exists on origin instead write
    git push
```

### Submitting PR
First you want to make sure your branch has all of the changes that are in main.
```bash

    git checkout main
    git pull
    git checkout YOUR_BRANCH
    git merge main
    # If there is a merge conflict it should appear now
    # In that case, open the conflicting files in vsCode and make any edits to get it working with all of the code mashed together.
    # When done editing/saving each of the conflict files run the below commands while in your branch.
    git add .
    git commit -m "sorted merge-conflict issues"
    git push
```
On github, go to the branch that you would like to merge to main. Click create PR. Compare with each other before merging any breaking changes.
